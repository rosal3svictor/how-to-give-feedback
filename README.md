# General Knowledge

- Review the difference between what we can observe about people and what we cannot, because it is like the part of the iceberg that is hidden under water.
- Review the danger of assuming things.
- It is essential to keep in mind that, to grow, you must not only be willing to receive feedback but you must also seek it.

# The iceberg: what should we focus the feedback on?

The first element that you have to take into account makes reference to the so-called Feedback Iceberg which is composed of three levels:

1. Behaviours
2. Attitudes
3. Perceptions
4. Values

it is important to consider that when you are given feedback, this is much more assimilable, understandable when it is about observed behaviours. This without leaving aside that everything you see from a person is just what is above the line of water, you just can see what they do, their behaviours. When you give feedback about behaviours, you could attempt to improve them but, without compromising attitudes, beliefs, the most inner characteristics of a person. However, when we give feedback about the "doings", we could change the behaviours.
